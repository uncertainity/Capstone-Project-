# Capstone-Project-

In this Capstone Project, we will develop normalising flow models and encoder/decoder networks with the variational autoencoder algorithm for a synthetic image dataset.

The primary task is to build normalising flow networks with random parameters to create an image dataset from the contour plots of the transformed distributions. We will then develop encoder and decoder networks with the variational autoencoder algorithm on this image dataset. 

This is part of course work for "Probabilistic Deep Learning with tensorflow probability"
